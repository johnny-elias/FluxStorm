# FluxStorm: Urban Drainage Network Analysis System

## Overview
FluxStorm is an educational implementation of a stormwater drainage analysis system that uses graph theory, particularly Kosaraju's algorithm, to analyze and optimize urban drainage networks. This project serves as a learning resource for understanding:
- Graph theory algorithms in practical applications
- Urban drainage system modeling
- Network analysis techniques
- Python object-oriented programming
